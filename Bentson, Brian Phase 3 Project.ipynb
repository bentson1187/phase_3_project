    "It is undoubtedly obvious how crucial a consistent water supply is to every living thing in this world. Without it, life is not sustainable. A human can survive without food on average for about 1 to 2 months. However, a human can only survive 3 days without water! This time-frame without water can be shortened even further in climates which are extremely hot and humid. Tanzania, located on the east coast of Africa on the Indian Ocean, has parts of the country that are extremely hot and humid. The average high and low temperature in the most populous city of Dar es Salaam during the year is 86$^\\circ$F and 70$^\\circ$F, respectively. Dar es Salaam is located on the coast and has a average relative humidity of 70%. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is, therefore, extremely imperative to be able to supply a consistent source of fresh water for sustainment of human life in Tanzania. This begins with the evaluation of water wells in Tanzania with an emphasis on how reliability can be maximized to ensure a consistent supply of water is attainable. Unfortunately, our reliance on equipment (in this case a mechanical pump) means that 100% reliability can never be achieved. It is best to consider both reliability of the equipment and how quickly we can respond to an equipment failure and get it back to a running state. The response time to fixing a mechanical failure can be shortened with first predicting which water wells will fail. This key information can help maintenance organizations to ensure they have labor, tools and supplies ready to be mobilized in case of a failure. I will use machine learning to build a model to best predict water well failures in an attempt to understand what improvements can be made to factors such as funding, technology and maintenance operations.\n",

    "The dataset has information on 59,400 water wells in Tanzania, for which only 55% are fully operational based on this dataset. Information on these water wells includes many important factors that impact their operability and will be explored in order to provide insight into how reliability, and therefore accessibility, can be maximized. I will clean and explore the data to best be utilized with a classification machine learning model to predict failure. "
